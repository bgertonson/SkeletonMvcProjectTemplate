# SkeletonMvcProjectTemplate
This is a Visual Studio project template for an ASP.NET MVC 3 site using Skeleton css template for responsive design.

This was made possible by a couple of blog posts and examples by Phil Haack.

# Installation
* __MAKE SURE ALL INSTANCES OF VISUAL STUDIO ARE CLOSED!__
* Run the 'build.cmd' batch file to make the VSIX installer for the template.  Then copy that file to your Visual Studio installation and double-click the .vsix file to install.

The batch file:

* Creates the project package (a zip file).
* Packages the template up in the Visual Studio installer extensible package (VSIX).

# Credits
* [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) Framework for responsive web design
* [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) used to archive the template into a zip file. 
* [Tim Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/) for the VSIX installer.
* [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com) for a sample template that I ripped off wholesale.
